# CO2 Emissions Analysis of the Turkish Automotive Market: A Comprehensive Assessment of Vehicle Sales and Environmental Performance in 2021

## Abstract

**Background:** The transportation sector contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions, with passenger vehicles accounting for a substantial portion. Turkey, as an emerging automotive market, presents a unique case study for understanding emission patterns in developing economies.

**Objectives:** This study analyzes CO2 emission characteristics of the Turkish automotive market in 2021, examining sales patterns, manufacturer performance, and environmental implications to inform policy decisions and industry strategies.

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 2021 Turkish vehicle sales data encompassing 919,156 vehicles across 39 manufacturers and 237 models. CO2 emissions were categorized into performance bands (0-120, 121-150, 151-180, 181-200, 200+ g/km) using weighted average calculations based on sales volumes. Statistical analysis included distribution analysis, manufacturer rankings, and environmental impact assessments.

**Results:** The weighted average CO2 emission for the Turkish market was 133.7 g/km, with significant variations across manufacturers. Toyota achieved the lowest emission level (103 g/km), followed by Peugeot (109 g/km) and Renault (113 g/km). Emission distribution showed 39.7% of vehicles in the excellent category (0-120 g/km), 43.2% in good category (121-150 g/km), 9.9% in moderate category (151-180 g/km), and 7.2% in high emission categories (180+ g/km). The analysis revealed 82.9% of vehicles met EU emission standards below 150 g/km.

**Conclusions:** The Turkish automotive market demonstrates relatively good environmental performance compared to global averages, with over 80% of vehicles meeting stringent emission standards. However, opportunities exist for further improvement through policy incentives for low-emission vehicles and manufacturer collaboration on clean technologies.

## 1. Introduction

The global transportation sector accounts for approximately 24% of energy-related CO2 emissions, representing 8.7 Gt CO2-equivalent annually according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2022). Within this sector, road transport constitutes 70% of direct emissions, making passenger vehicle emissions a critical component of climate change mitigation strategies (Rimpas et al., 2025).

Turkey's automotive market represents a significant emerging economy case study, with growing vehicle ownership rates and evolving environmental regulations. The country's strategic position between Europe and Asia, combined with its developing economy and increasing urbanization, creates unique emission profile characteristics that warrant detailed analysis.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of market-specific emission analyses for developing effective climate policies. Wang et al. (2024) emphasized that extensive fossil fuel use in emerging economies is intertwined with urbanization and global climate change, necessitating region-specific approaches to emission reduction.

The European Union's Green Deal, targeting net-zero emissions by 2050, has established stringent emission standards influencing global automotive markets (Hainsch et al., 2022). These policies create pressure on emerging markets like Turkey to align with international environmental standards while maintaining economic growth.

This study addresses critical gaps in understanding emission patterns in emerging automotive markets by providing the first comprehensive analysis of CO2 emissions across the entire Turkish vehicle market for 2021. Our research questions include:

1. What are the emission characteristics of the Turkish automotive market?
2. How do different manufacturers perform in terms of CO2 emissions?
3. What policy implications emerge from market emission patterns?

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Transportation Emissions and Climate Change

Transportation emissions have become a central focus in climate change mitigation strategies. The IPCC (2022) reports that transportation accounted for 15% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, with projections indicating potential growth of 16-50% by 2050 without intervention.

Recent comprehensive reviews by Ferrer and Thomé (2023) identified three key dimensions for carbon emission reduction in transportation: enablers and barriers, benefits and disadvantages, and measurement metrics. Their analysis of 30 review papers covering 3,561 original articles emphasized the need for context-dependent approaches varying by country and transport mode.

### 2.2 Electric Vehicle Transition and Emission Reduction

The transition to electric vehicles represents a primary strategy for transportation decarbonization. Rimpas et al. (2025) conducted an extensive review of electric vehicle technologies, concluding that EVs offer threefold efficiency improvements over internal combustion engines and significant emission reductions when powered by renewable energy sources.

However, emission benefits vary significantly by region. In coal-dependent electricity grids, electric vehicle emissions can approach those of efficient internal combustion engines (Mofolasayo, 2023). This finding underscores the importance of comprehensive market analysis that considers local energy mix characteristics.

### 2.3 Automotive Market Dynamics and Policy Implications

Recent studies have examined policy impacts on automotive emission trends. Huang (2021) analyzed global policy frameworks under carbon neutrality commitments, concluding that automotive enterprises must establish carbon neutrality targets and accelerate clean technology implementation.

The European automotive market provides relevant benchmarks for emerging economies. Studies show that EU markets have achieved significant emission reductions through regulatory frameworks, technological improvements, and consumer incentive programs (Haas & Sander, 2020).

### 2.4 Emerging Market Characteristics

Emerging automotive markets present unique challenges and opportunities for emission reduction. Rapid economic growth typically correlates with increased vehicle ownership, potentially offsetting technological improvements (Wei et al., 2023). However, these markets also offer opportunities for leapfrogging to cleaner technologies without legacy infrastructure constraints.

Turkey's automotive market characteristics align with broader emerging market trends while presenting specific regional factors. The country's EU accession negotiations have influenced environmental regulations, creating a hybrid regulatory environment combining emerging market flexibility with European environmental standards.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection and Sources

This study utilized comprehensive 2021 Turkish automotive sales data obtained from the official "Marka Model Emisyon Bilgisi 2021-2024" dataset. The dataset encompasses complete market information including manufacturer, model, monthly sales volumes, and CO2 emission values for each vehicle variant.

### 3.2 Data Processing and Categorization

Vehicle CO2 emissions were categorized into five performance bands based on EU emission standards and environmental impact assessments:
- Excellent: 0-120 g/km
- Good: 121-150 g/km  
- Moderate: 151-180 g/km
- Poor: 181-200 g/km
- Very Poor: 200+ g/km

### 3.3 Statistical Analysis Methods

Weighted average calculations were employed to account for sales volume variations across models and manufacturers. The weighted average CO2 emission was calculated as:

CO2_weighted = Σ(Sales_i × CO2_i) / Σ(Sales_i)

Where Sales_i represents sales volume for vehicle i and CO2_i represents the CO2 emission for vehicle i.

### 3.4 Manufacturer Performance Analysis

Manufacturer rankings were determined using sales-weighted average emissions. This approach ensures that high-volume models have appropriate influence on overall manufacturer performance, providing realistic market impact assessments.

### 3.5 Environmental Impact Assessment

Environmental impact calculations included:
- Total market CO2 output estimations
- Emission category distributions
- Policy compliance assessments against EU standards
- Comparative analysis with international benchmarks
